                    Greetings! I am Quan Tang, a guy who isn't interested in anything at the moment, but I used to be into game development and some math topics. 
                    I am from Yangzhou and I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in Information Technology, 
                    as well as working as a full-time full-stack developer.
